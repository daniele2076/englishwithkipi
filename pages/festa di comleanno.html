    <h2>üéâ Jake‚Äôs Birthday Party</h2>
    <p>
      Jake had his birthday party on Saturday. He invited his friends to his house. The living room was decorated with balloons, streamers, and a big banner that said ‚ÄúHappy Birthday Jake!‚Äù<br><br>
      The party started at 3 o‚Äôclock. Jake wore a blue shirt and a party hat. His friends brought gifts and cards. Jake opened a box and found a toy robot inside. He smiled and said thank you.<br><br>
      They played games like musical chairs and pin the tail on the donkey. Everyone laughed and had fun.<br><br>
      Jake‚Äôs mom brought out a chocolate cake with nine candles. Everyone sang ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù and Jake blew out the candles.<br><br>
      After cake, they danced to music and ate snacks like popcorn and juice. Jake said it was the best birthday ever.
