    <h2>üê£ A Happy Easter Day</h2>
    <p>
      On Easter morning, the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Children woke up excited and ran outside to look for colorful eggs.<br><br>
      The garden was full of surprises. Behind trees, under benches, and near flowers, there were chocolate eggs and jelly beans. Some eggs were big, some were small, and some had toys inside.<br><br>
      One child found a golden egg with a ribbon. It had a little bunny toy inside. Everyone laughed and shared their treats.<br><br>
      After the egg hunt, families sat together for lunch. They ate roasted chicken, vegetables, and sweet bread. For dessert, there was carrot cake and chocolate nests.<br><br>
      In the afternoon, children played games and painted eggs with bright colors. It was a joyful day full of fun and smiles.
